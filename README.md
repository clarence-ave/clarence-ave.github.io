## Objection Email Template

**Subject:** Objection to Proposed Parking Changes in Clarence Avenue

Dear Parking Design Team,

I am writing to formally object to the proposed parking changes outlined in *The Medway Council (Rochester) (Waiting Restrictions and Parking Places) (Amendment No. 24) Order 2024*, specifically the introduction of double yellow lines at the northern end of Clarence Avenue and outside No. 17.  

I reside at `[Your Address]`, Clarence Avenue. Parking is already a significant challenge for residents, and the proposed changes will unnecessarily reduce the limited parking spaces available to us.  

### Grounds for Objection  

1. **Sufficient Access to Garages**: 
   The garages at the northern end of the street are not used for car storage. Even if they were, there is already enough space for vehicles to access them without the need for double yellow lines.  

2. **Existing Disabled Parking Space**:  
   Outside No. 16, there is already a designated disabled parking space. Extending restrictions in this area will further reduce parking availability for all residents.  

3. **No Traffic Flow Issues**:  
   Clarence Avenue is a dead-end street with no through traffic. The proposed restrictions offer no traffic management benefit.  

4. **Impact on Residents**:  
   The removal of parking spaces will make it harder for residents, including families and elderly individuals, to find nearby parking.  

I kindly urge the council to reconsider these changes, as they will create unnecessary hardship for residents without providing meaningful benefits.  

Yours faithfully,  
`[Your Name]`
`[Your Address]`
