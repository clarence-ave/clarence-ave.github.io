## Objection Email Template  

**Subject:** Objection to Proposed Parking Changes in Clarence Avenue  

Dear Parking Design Team,  

I am writing to formally object to the proposed parking changes outlined in *The Medway Council (Rochester) (Waiting Restrictions and Parking Places) (Amendment No. 24) Order 2024*, specifically the introduction of double yellow lines at the northern end of Clarence Avenue and outside No. 17.  

I reside at `[Your Address]`, Clarence Avenue. Parking is already a significant challenge for residents, and the proposed changes will unnecessarily reduce the limited parking spaces available to us.  

### Grounds for Objection  

1. **Sufficient Access to Garages**: 
   The garages at the northern end of the street are not used for car storage. Even if they were, there is already enough space for vehicles to access them without the need for double yellow lines.  

2. **Existing Disabled Parking Space**:  
   Outside No. 16, there is already a designated disabled parking space. Extending restrictions in this area will further reduce parking availability for all residents.  

3. **No Traffic Flow Issues**:  
   Clarence Avenue is a dead-end street with no through traffic. The proposed restrictions offer no traffic management benefit.  

4. **Impact on Residents**:  
   The removal of parking spaces will make it harder for residents, including families and elderly individuals, to find nearby parking.  

I kindly urge the council to reconsider these changes, as they will create unnecessary hardship for residents without providing meaningful benefits.  

Yours faithfully,  
`[Your Name]`
`[Your Address]`

This website is dedicated to informing residents of Clarence Avenue, Rochester, about the proposed parking restrictions and helping them submit objections to the council.  

## Purpose of This Website  

The Medway Council has proposed changes to parking regulations on Clarence Avenue, including the addition of double yellow lines at the dead-end section of our street and in front of house No. 17. These changes will:  
- Reduce the already limited parking spaces on our street.  
- Make parking more difficult for residents.  
- Provide no real traffic or safety benefits, as Clarence Avenue is a dead-end with minimal traffic.  

This website aims to:  
1. Provide detailed information about the council's proposal.  
2. Help residents submit objections before the deadline: **Friday, 6 December 2024**.
